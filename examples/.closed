# Would be nice to have something like [default:windows]
# And maybe an variables thing. Like the only thing we want to change here is -L.
# And maybe have an OS variable that we can concat with paths. For example: ./vendor/$os
# Btw I always get the paths mixed and stuff. Maybe fix that? Feels weird how it is not the same with the others.
