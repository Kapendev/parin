# ðŸ§ª Examples

This folder provides example projects to help you get started.

> [!NOTE]
> Assets: If an example uses textures, fonts, or other assets,
> make sure to download the [assets](../assets/) folder in this repository
> and replace the project's assets folder with it.

> [!NOTE]
> Memory Leaks: To keep the examples short, they don't free resources.
> In debug builds, Parin will show a memory leak summary at the end if any leaks are found.
> This is normal behavior.
